  - Follow this link: <a href="https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php">Look up account for CSE 15L</a>
  - Sign in using your UCSD username and PID and a page that looks like this should open up:

  - You'll see under **Additional Accounts** your course-specific username for CSE 15L

  (If you have multiple accounts, look for the one that begins with **cs15l**-

  - You will also need to set a password for that account so click on that link with your CSE 15L user
  - Click on the link labeled in this picture:
