I used the up arrow once to login to ieng6 because I already had used it just before.

I went into GitHub to fork the repository then I copied the html link and cloned it in the command line

I then ran the code sh tests.sh to run the tests to show they fail

To edit the code I typed vim ListExamples.java. \<q\> until at the line needed to be fixed. \<l\>\<l\>\<l\>\<l\>\<l\>\<l\>\<l\>\<l\>\<l\>\<l\>\<l\>\<x\>\<i\>. Then I typed 2 to insert. \<esc\>. Then I typed :wq to exit and save my changed.
